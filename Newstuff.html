    Parentsquare helps staff virtually health check the students and is expected to be done before school. A staff member is needed to check you in before you have access to the inside of the building. And after a trip, it is required you have at least a week of virtual education before you may be educated in-person. to ensure safety, after 3 weeks of in-person school, you must do 1 week of virtual school or complete a COVID test and turn it in before a certain deadline.
